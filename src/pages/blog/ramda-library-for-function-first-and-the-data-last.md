Ramda, is a Javascript library that helps to create functional style for your programming code. Notably, you can compose your functions just like what we learnt math functions in school, like `f(g(x))`, and easily create a functional pipelines that not mutate any user data. Immutability and side-effect free functions are at the heart of its design philosophy. All functions are automatically curried, and passed parameters are arranged accordingly for ease of use.

## Curry

Curry is a function that will return a new function until it receives all it's arguments. You must be wondering what to do with this flavouring name? It is actually taken from the name of Haskell Curry, who was one of the first to investigate such techniques.
